# Audio HAL

The Audio HAL handles audio input and output operations. It abstracts the details of audio drivers and provides a consistent interface to the Android framework.

Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) characterizes the classic interface on which audio services depend. The hardware manufacturers or vendors must implement this interface for audio hardware to function correctly. Androidâ€™s audio HAL is responsible to connect the top-level sound specific framework related methods available in android.media to the elemental audio related driver and hardware. The code for audio HAL is placed in **hardware/libhardware/include/hardware**.

There are two interfaces for the Audio HAL,

- **The interface which represents the main functions of an audio device.** : hardware/libhardware/include/hardware/audio.h.

- **The interface which represents effects which can be applied on audio like echo cancellation effect, noise suppression, downmixing effect, etc.** : hardware/libhardware/include/hardware/audio_effect.h.

## Key Functions
- **Initialization**: Setup audio hardware.
- **Stream Management**: Manage audio streams for playback and recording.
- **Audio Routing**: Handle routing of audio to different devices (speakers, headphones, etc.).
